# Welcome to the Climate Cooperative

The Climate Cooperative open source project is more than just software; it's a movement! We believe in the power of collaboration to tackle the monumental challenge of climate change. No single person, organization, or country can solve this crisis alone. It demands a global community of diverse backgrounds, ideas, and talents.

## **Our Mission**

In particular, this project is dedicated to advancing carbon-neutral, sustainable energy solutions for homes. Residential energy use is estimated to account for [20% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the US](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922205117). To meet the targets set by the Paris Climate Agreement—a 45% emissions reduction by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050—eliminating these residential energy emissions will be crucial. And because home appliances often have lifespans of decades, this residential technology transition needs to begin immediately.

We believe that the technology exists today for the residential sector to meet those benchmarks on time, but several obstacles stand in the way of that transition. We have identified 3 major obstacles that we believe must be addressed to achieve those goals in time:
1. **Education** - Many are unaware of their home's impact on carbon emissions, and even those who are aware may not know the choices available to reduce that impact.
2. **"The Green Premium"** - Upgrading to electric and energy efficient alternatives often costs significantly more than like-for-like replacements of old appliances, which discourages adoption of cleaner technologies.
3. **Workforce** - Installation of newer appliances often requires special training and there currently are not enough trained installers to meet the hypothetical demands of a worldwide residential energy transition over the next decade.

Through the Climate Cooperative, we aim to unite brilliant and passionate individuals from varying domains and backgrounds to collaborate on solutions to these problems and more.

Our mission is to foster the development of a collection of relevant data, technology solutions, tools, processes, hardware and software that will be open-source and available to any individual, company, organization, school or foundation who wishes to use these tools to further the goal of reducing carbon emissions or to explore learning, creativity, research or education relating to climate change. The Climate Cooperative is the platform to unite everyone—regardless of origin, belief, or experience—in making a significant, positive impact on our planet. 

We firmly believe that the solutions to our shared future on this planet should also be shared and available to anyone or any group with the ingenuity, creativity and drive to improve them. Let’s succeed together.


## **Our Community**

Though we are in the early stages of building the community, we envision it growing into a large, diverse group of individuals who are passionate about creating sustainable energy solutions. As a member of the Climate Cooperative, you have the unique opportunity to collaborate with other passionate and talented people to shape the future of energy efficiency. Together, let’s create a resource of rich, educational, and useful software tools that can be used and improved by anyone to reduce carbon emissions in residential homes.

### **Our Current Projects**
- **[Home Energy Assessment Database & API](https://github.com/Zwell-Home/home-energy-assessment-database)**: The Home Energy Assessment Database & API consolidates diverse data into a unified platform for accurately calculating home carbon footprints, considering factors like local energy grids, local climate, and home appliances and attributes. A live proof-of-concept application can be found here: **[Home Energy Audit](https://zwellhome.com/)**. The database and API aim to provide crucial data for energy savings tools, detailed analyses, and visualizations, empowering stakeholders to reduce residential energy consumption and promote sustainable solutions.

### **Future Development Roadmap**
- **[Carbon Offset Marketplace](https://github.com/climate-cooperative/carbon-offset-marketplace)**:  Providing a direct to consumer platform for purchasing carbon offsets by financing home energy reduction projects. Requirements would be standards and processes required for recipients of the offset funds in order to guarantee new, incremental carbon reductions with a high certainty. The marketplace would provide access to community sourced carbon offsets that have both social and environmental benefits, and in turn would provide financial incentive for homeowners, contractors, or developers to make environmentally beneficial retrofits in homes.
  - Sub Project - [Live Carbon Reduction Counter](https://github.com/climate-cooperative/live-carbon-reduction-counter): a tool for professionals to recieve a collective total of attributable carbon reductions from their work or installations, potentially for display on their website.
- **Home Appliances & Mechanical Systems Database:** This module allows consumers to upload appliance information into a home profile simply by taking a picture, supported by a comprehensive database detailing appliance lifespan. It includes a recommendation system that suggests the best products based on remaining useful life, retrofit practicality, and cost-effective CO2 reduction, alongside features for managing home profiles.
- **Home Energy Audit & Recommendations:** This software tool provides precise recommendations for products, detailing applicable incentives and tax rebates to encourage energy-efficient upgrades. It's designed to simplify the process of making homes more energy-efficient by providing tailored advice and financial benefits information.
- **Home Energy Contractor Database:** The Home Energy Contractor Database offers a comprehensive platform for contractors, featuring profile pages, a search function, and an aggregation of reviews. Contractors can manage their profiles, showcasing pictures, logos, descriptions, hours, contact details, and licensing information, enhancing visibility and trust with potential customers.
