# Welcome to the Climate Cooperative

The Climate Cooperative open source project is more than just software; it's a movement! We believe in the power of collaboration to tackle the monumental challenge of climate change. No single person, organization, or country can solve this crisis alone. It demands a global community of diverse backgrounds, ideas, and talents.

## **Our Mission**

In particular, this project is dedicated to advancing carbon-neutral, sustainable energy solutions for homes. Residential energy use is estimated to account for [20% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the US](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922205117). To meet the targets set by the Paris Climate Agreement—a 45% emissions reduction by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050—eliminating these residential energy emissions will be crucial. And because home appliances often have lifespans of decades, this residential technology transition needs to begin immediately.

We believe that the technology exists today for the residential sector to meet those benchmarks on time, but several obstacles stand in the way of that transition. We have identified 3 major obstacles that we believe must be addressed to achieve those goals in time:
1. **Education** - Many are unaware of their home's impact on carbon emissions, and even those who are aware may not know the choices available to reduce that impact.
2. **"The Green Premium"** - Upgrading to electric and energy efficient alternatives often costs significantly more than like-for-like replacements of old appliances, which discourages adoption of cleaner technologies.
3. **Workforce** - Installation of newer appliances often requires special training and there currently are not enough trained installers to meet the hypothetical demands of a worldwide residential energy transition over the next decade.

Through the Climate Cooperative, we aim to unite brilliant and passionate individuals from varying domains and backgrounds to collaborate on solutions to these problems and more.

Our mission is to foster the development of a collection of relevant data, technology solutions, tools, processes, hardware and software that will be open-source and available to any individual, company, organization, school or foundation who wishes to use these tools to further the goal of reducing carbon emissions or to explore learning, creativity, research or education relating to climate change. The Climate Cooperative is the platform to unite everyone—regardless of origin, belief, or experience—in making a significant, positive impact on our planet. 

We firmly believe that the solutions to our shared future on this planet should also be shared and available to anyone or any group with the ingenuity, creativity and drive to improve them. Let’s succeed together.


## **Our Community**

We're just beginning to build our community, but we envision it becoming a vibrant and diverse hub of individuals who are deeply committed to fighting climate change. As a member of the Climate Cooperative, you'll have the chance to work alongside other dedicated and skilled individuals to pioneer the future of clean energy. Together, let’s create a dynamic resource of rich, educational, and useful software tools that anyone can use and enhance to reduce residential carbon emissions. Join us in making a real difference!

### **Current Projects & Applications**

- **[Home Energy Assessment Database & API](https://github.com/Zwell-Home/home-energy-assessment-database)**: The Home Energy Assessment Database & API consolidates diverse data into a unified platform for accurately calculating home carbon footprints, considering factors like local energy grids, local climate, and home appliances and attributes. A live proof-of-concept application can be found here: **[Home Energy Audit](https://zwellhome.com/)**. The database and API aim to provide crucial data for energy savings tools, detailed analyses, and visualizations, empowering stakeholders to reduce residential energy consumption and promote sustainable solutions.

### **New Ideas and Project Proposals**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check out [Dicussions](https://github.com/orgs/climate-cooperative/discussions) to propose a new idea (or review the community's ideas and find a project that inspires you)!

Our goal is to develop solutions to support the transition to net zero carbon emissions from home energy consumption. There may be—and almost certainly are—many more great ideas not yet proposed here. If you've got an idea for a software application that could make an impact on that goal, post in [Dicussions](https://github.com/orgs/climate-cooperative/discussions) and let's start a conversation!
